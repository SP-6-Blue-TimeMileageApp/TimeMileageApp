# TimeMileageApp
We are designing an app that will track a person's location from two points. While the app is running there will be data post-processed based on the information retrieved from google maps API that will provide data such as how far they went, their average speed, and route taken on the trip. The app will be available on all platforms and will have a two-tier system.


The base tier will provide basic information about trips such as the distance, average speed, time, start location, and stop location. This base version will also contain the ability to view the history of trips but will contain ads located both on the home page and history page. 


The second tier will be a paid version of the app that will contain no ads across any page of the app. This tier will also contain more features such as more detail for trips taken such as gps tagging and the ability to view up to the past 5 years of trips taken. 


Both tiers will contain features that will allow the user to track the location between two points, download a excel file for tax purposes around tax season, see information about previous trips, change basic information about account (contact email, password, etc...).
